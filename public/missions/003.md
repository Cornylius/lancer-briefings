# Mission // #003
## Dark Thorn

A number of weapons have been stolen from a secure Hand of Tyr armory, and while Steel has been stretched too thin to deal with it directly, your arrival brings great relief as he assigns the newly-christned NGR-7 to handle the task.

# Goals
- Find out where the weapons are.
- Destroy, or preferably, retrieve whatever assets you can.

# Stakes
- Every weapon that leaves the frontline is used instead to destabilize what little order remains among survivors while equally weakening the struggling Hand of Tyr defenses. If the Oneida line falls, it may be impossible to stop the domino effect that would soon follow. 

# Reserves
- Steel will provide what he can.
