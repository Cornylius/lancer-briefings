# Mission // #002
## Patient Wastes

Not knowing what threats lay beyond the safety of the mountains prevents the Hand of Tyr from properly preparing defensive positions. The squad is requested to push beyond held territory and into no-mans-land and identify whatever friends, foes, or other parties exist outside Sif's door.

# Goals
- Identify one or more threats beyond the Oneida defensive line.

# Stakes
- The mission places the squad in uncontrolled and dangerous territory, to fail this assignment would leave Tyr's forces vulnerable to whatever lurks in the shadows.

# Reserves
- Orbital Bombardment.
- Additional Core.
