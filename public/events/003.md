# TYR Hardcomm/Heimdallr // 3.25.5016u

**NGR-7** arrived safely in **NASSER'S CLEFT**, the largest city along the **ONEIDA** line. The city was in disrepair, stretched beyond its limits and means by the nearly 10 Million refugees who fled north in the aftermath of **DAWNSIDE**'s fall. After moving carefully through the vast tent-city that surrounds **NASSER'S**, they eventually arrived at the **HAND OF TYR** base, **FJELLHEIM**. 

Situated at the southern entrance of the valley in which the city sits, **FJELLHEIM** consists of a wide steel and concrete wall reaching 40 feet up from the earth below, its length marked every 80-odd feet by a sturdy tower topped with heavy cannon weaponry. Once a dated emplacement, a remnant of the **KAIJU EMERGENCE** from ages long past, the base has found new purpose as a powerful central battery to hold the **ORGANIC** at bay.

Upon entering the base's grounds, the squad is greeted by **STEEL**, the TYR Commanding Officer who manages **FJELLHEIM** as well as the many outposts along the **ONEIDA MOUNTAIN RANGE** that define the **ONEIDA ABSOLUTE DEFENSE LINE**.
