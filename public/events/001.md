# TYR Hardcomm/Heimdallr // 2.21.5016u
Pilots **PACKRAT**, **KNIGHT**, **TANTALUS**, and **\[DATA-LOST]**, deployed in Warehouse #102 on the currently-sieged **SIF** along the **ONEIDA-LINE**, deployed by Commanding Officer **STEEL**. Squad managed meager introductions before **INCURSION** began.

Combat erupts as waves of **ORGANIC** approached the warehouse, threatening to push beyond the absolute defense line. Pilots held the line in ernest, fighting with every blade, bullet, and system at their hands.

The fight was brutal, the battle was won, but at a cost. Pilot **\[DATA-LOST]**, Name **VINNIE** fell to overwhelming forces.

Pilot **PACKRAT** reports intelligent, emotive movement from **ORGANIC** forces, notably from the same Mech which executed **VINNIE**. **PACKRAT** reported this tentatively to **TANTALUS**

Report written by **TANTALUS** sent to **HEIMDALLR** command in ORACL station over the planet's surface.
